        <h3>Current Stage: Styling </h3>
        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! Whilst I am not well-studied in front-end development, I wanted to create a page that demonstrated my tenacity for learning and a place to showcase the projects I have worked on.</p>
        <p>This site is a constant work in progress as I learn more about programming, JS especially, and incorporate things that I find cool into this page. </p>
        <p> Don't hesitate to contact me using the email se612@bath.ac.uk or +44 07455 286322 for any queries or points of advice. Cheers. </p>

        <h2> Projects I have worked on. </h2>
        <p> Here are a few projects I am particularly proud of, in a range of languages, all built to fill a need in my workflow or an idea that I thought would be a fun opportunity to learn a new skill. </p>

        <h3>Newton's Fractal. </h3>
        <p> Numerical Analysis coursework </p>
        <p> <span class = 'python'> #Python </span> </p>
        
        <h3>Front-end Development. </h3>
        <p>The Portfolio page was created from the ground up following online courses and inspiration from YouTube videos. </p>
        <p> <span class = 'html'> #HTML </span> <span class = 'css'> #CSS </span> <span class = 'javascript'> #Javascript </span> </p>

        <h3>Call-by-Value Machine. </h3>
        <p> As part of my Functional Programming module, we studied the process of beta reduction and alpha conversion. This machine provides the code and examples that given any abstraction can reduce any redex as well as the inclusions of integers. This coursework project achieved an 86% in Year 2.  </p>
        <p> <span class = 'haskell'> #Haskell </span> </p>

        <h3>Local Primary School Data Clean Up. </h3>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class = 'excel'> #Excel </span> </p>

        <h3> Sports Graphics. </h3>
        <p> Inspired by The Athletic </p>
        <p> <span class = 'sql'> #SQL </span> <span class = 'python' > #Python </span> </p>

        <h3> Project 6. </h3>
        <p> Work In Progress. </p>
        <p> <span> # </span> </p>

        <h2>Interests outside of the project.</h2>
        <p> Outside of my professional career, these are where you will typically find me. I am always an amateur. </p>

    <div class = "box">
        <p> Finally, I'd like to thank a few sources for the mass generation of both the ideas and production of this page. Hyperplexed, Youtube videos on CSS and JS that you see the number effect in the hero pager and sliding image track. </p>
