        <h1>Samuel Evans<span>.</span></h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! Whilst I am not well-studied in front-end development, I wanted to create a page that demonstrated my tenacity for learning and a place to showcase the projects I have worked on.</p>
        <p>This site is a constant work in progress as I learn more about programming, JS especially, and incorporate things that I find cool into this page. </p>
        <p> Don't hesitate to contact me using the email se612@bath.ac.uk or +44 07455 286322 for any queries or points of advice. Cheers. </p>

        <h2> Projects I have worked on. </h2>
        <p> Here are a few projects I am particularly proud of, in a range of languages, all built to fill a need in my workflow or an idea that I thought would be a fun opportunity to learn a new skill. </p>
