    <h1>Samuel Evans.</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! Whilst I am not well-studied in front-end development, I wanted to create a page that demonstrated my tenacity for learning and place to showcase the projects I have worked on.</p>
    <p>This site is a constant work in progress as I learn more about programming, JS especially, and incorporate things that I find cool into this page. </p>
    <p>Please contact me using the email se612@bath.ac.uk or, alternatively, +44 07455 286322 for any queruies or points of advice. Cheers. </p>
